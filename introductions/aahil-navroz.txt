Hello, my name is Aahil Navroz and my interest in economics is Econometrics and Applied Economics. I am also interested in data analysis and statistics. During my free time, I enjoy watching soccer and cycling. My favorite team is AC Milan, but I am a big fan of Erling Haaland. When it comes to cycling, my favorite is Tadej Pogacar.
